# Target Development & Feature Engineering

Jupyter notebooks outlining the ways I have transformed my target variable to reduce variability, transform distributions, and  improve models' predictive capabilities.

_A simple script that you can use as a shortcut to install the necessary packages in a new virtual environment with Anaconda to run this project through._
2. [Ames Housing Data Project](https://github.com/sonyah-hawaii/target_development/blob/master/Project%202.ipynb)  
_This project outlines different techniques to transform the target as well as the independent variables in order to improve predictions in a dataset with abnormal distribution and high variance. Sections include:_
	1. Exploratory Data Analysis
	2. Cleaning & prepping data
	3. Feature engineering
	4. Model development with train-test split
	5. Model comparison & fine-tuning

These notebooks includes the following packages and languages:
- `Numpy` and `Pandas`
